# Implementation Plan - Phase 1: Advanced Features & Enhancements

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing advanced features and enhancements to the VPN Reseller Billing & Management Suite, building upon the foundational Phase 0.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Intelligent Analytics Dashboard
- Develop a dashboard page under `src/app/analytics` showing KPIs for representatives:
  - Total sales, monthly sales trends
  - Payment status overview
  - Alerts for low performance or overdue payments
- Backend API endpoints to aggregate sales and payment data
- Use charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) for visualizations
- Implement alert notifications on dashboard and optionally via email/Telegram

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration
- Create a Telegram bot using `node-telegram-bot-api` or similar
- Integrate bot with backend to:
  - Send invoices as PDF attachments to representatives
  - Send payment reminders and notifications
- Secure bot communication and store chat IDs linked to representatives
- Provide UI for admin to configure and trigger notifications

### 3. Automated Backup and Restore System
- Use Google Drive API to:
  - Periodically backup invoices, payments, and representative data as JSON or CSV
  - Provide restore functionality to recover data from backups
- Implement backup scheduling (e.g., daily or weekly) using cron jobs or serverless functions
- Secure backup data with encryption and access controls

### 4. Enhanced Sales Accounting
- Add detailed reports with filters (date range, representative, status)
- Implement reconciliation features to match payments with invoices
- Export reports to Excel or PDF
- Backend APIs to support report generation and reconciliation logic

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for API routes and utility functions using Jest
- Write integration tests for key workflows (login, invoice import, payment logging)
- Implement E2E tests using Cypress or Playwright for critical user flows
- Set up CI pipeline to run tests on push

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- Add subtle animations and transitions using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility
- Enhance navigation and user feedback (loading spinners, success/error toasts)

### 7. User Roles and Permissions
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Define roles: Admin, Operator, Representative
- Protect routes and API endpoints based on roles
- UI adjustments to show/hide features per role

### 8. Performance Optimization
- Analyze and optimize bundle size and load times
- Implement server-side caching for API responses
- Optimize database queries and indexing (if applicable)
- Use lazy loading and code splitting for frontend components

## Dependencies and Tools
- Chart.js or Recharts for charts
- node-telegram-bot-api for Telegram integration
- Google Drive API client
- Jest, Cypress/Playwright for testing
- Framer Motion for animations
- RBAC libraries or custom middleware

## Integration Points
- Extend existing API routes and add new ones under `src/pages/api/analytics`, `src/pages/api/notifications`, `src/pages/api/backup`
- Add new React components and pages under `src/app/analytics`, `src/app/admin`
- Modify authentication and middleware for role checks

## Follow-up Steps
- Review and approve this plan
- Implement features incrementally with testing
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Prepare deployment and monitoring setup
