# Implementation Plan - Phase 0: Foundation & Setup

## Overview
This plan covers the initial foundation and setup for the VPN Reseller Billing & Management Suite web application, aligned with the confirmed project plan and mandate. The implementation will be based on the existing Next.js environment.

## Goals
- Initialize and organize project structure for frontend and backend within Next.js framework.
- Set up Docker environment for local development including Nginx, backend API, and PostgreSQL database.
- Implement basic user authentication (Operator login/logout) using JWT and password hashing.
- Create a basic navigation shell with sidebar or top bar for main modules.
- Integrate Persian language support using i18next with react-i18next and configure RTL styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure all UI components follow the Persian-first, RTL, and accessibility guidelines.

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure
- Organize frontend components under `src/components`.
- Use Next.js `app` directory for routing and page structure.
- Separate API routes for backend logic within Next.js API routes or consider a separate backend service if needed.

### 2. Docker Environment Setup
- Create Dockerfile for Next.js frontend.
- Create Dockerfile for backend API if separated.
- Create docker-compose.yml to orchestrate Next.js app, PostgreSQL database, and Nginx reverse proxy.
- Configure Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL termination (if applicable).

### 3. Authentication
- Implement Operator login and logout pages.
- Use JWT for authentication tokens stored in HttpOnly, Secure cookies.
- Use bcrypt.js for password hashing.
- Protect routes and API endpoints requiring authentication.

### 4. Navigation Shell
- Design and implement a persistent sidebar or top navigation bar.
- Include main modules navigation links.
- Implement breadcrumbs for deeper navigation.

### 5. Persian Language & RTL Support
- Integrate i18next with react-i18next for Persian language support.
- Configure Tailwind CSS for RTL layout.
- Use Persian fonts (e.g., Vazirmatn, Sahel) for typography.
- Ensure all UI components and pages follow RTL and Persian UI/UX guidelines.

### 6. Accessibility & UI/UX
- Ensure keyboard navigation support.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast.
- Basic screen reader compatibility.
- Follow the UI/UX guiding principles for clarity, efficiency, and operator control.

## Dependencies
- Next.js (existing)
- Tailwind CSS (existing or to be configured)
- react-i18next
- i18next
- bcrypt.js
- jsonwebtoken
- Docker, docker-compose
- PostgreSQL

## Follow-up Steps
- After foundation setup, proceed to Phase 1: Core Representative & Invoice Management.
- Implement testing strategy for authentication and navigation components.
- Prepare documentation for setup and usage.
